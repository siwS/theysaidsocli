This is a simple CLI gem to get quotes from the [theysaidso](https://theysaidso.com/api/) API.
If you need some inspiration during your day, just pick your daily quote from your command line!

## Installation

You can install by running:

    $ gem install theysaidsocli

## Usage

You can run in your command line:

- `theysaidsocli` : gets you the Quote of the day!
- `Theysaidsocli -cat` : gets you all the available quote categories
- `Theysaidsocli -cat life` : gets you a quote from the "life" category


### TODO:

The API is rate-limited so with the free version you can make 10 requests per hour.
I doubt people will need more than that in a CLI, but I will implement at some point passing an API key to get unlimited quotes

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
